# We are going to keep a list of players that are active

# Login_request

# First you check if the guy is login by searching through the active clients
handleLoginRequest
If the guy is already logged in:
    send a invalid state
else:
    make a new instance of Player
    check if the file with that name exists
    if name does not exist:
        open a new file
        randomize stats
        write stats to the file
        initialize the player
    else if name exists:
        open an existed file
        read from the file and initialize the player
