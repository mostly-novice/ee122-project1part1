(1) speak is broken
(2) login twice with same name = segfault
(3) do we need to be notified when we try and attack ourselves? login kevin, attack kevin -- 
(4) login with >3 clients, the command> prompt goes away
(5) Attack someone to death -- causes all clients to crash
(6) when logging out of a server  (but not out of game) should you broadcast a logout?
