client recieved malformed message : “Meteor is striking the world.”

If the connection with the server has terminated for somehow (e.g., the server crashed, the
network went down, ...), the client must exit with the error message “The gate to the tiny
world of warcraft has disappeared.”


Robustness: your client must be able to handle socket errors without crash. Please recall that
 the client can fail connect(), recv(), and send().


 ecurity: you client must avoid buffer overflow and memory leak. TAs will intentionally inject
a malformed message to exploit them.


check that recieve package is 32-bit aligned -- otherwise we need to specify that it is malformed.
